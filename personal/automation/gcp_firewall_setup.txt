# üöÄ Quick Guide: Creating a Firewall Rule with Specific Source & Destination IPs in GCP Using Terraform

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Firewall Rule  
Modify `terraform.tfvars` to specify your firewall rule settings:

```
firewall_name       = "allow-ssh-access"
source_ips          = ["203.0.113.100", "198.51.100.0/24"]  # Allowed source IPs
destination_ips     = ["10.0.0.10", "10.0.0.20"]  # VMs that should receive traffic
allowed_ports       = ["22"]  # SSH access
network_name        = "pexip"
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Apply the Firewall Rule  
Run the following command to deploy the firewall rule:

```
terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```
‚úîÔ∏è This will create the firewall rule based on your specified settings.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Firewall Rule  
To confirm that the rule has been applied:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="name=allow-ssh-access"
```

To view detailed rule information:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules describe allow-ssh-access
```
